oh-my-zsh is an open source, community-driven framework for managing your ZSH configuration. It comes bundled with a ton of helpful functions, helpers, plugins, themes, and few things that make you shout...

bq. "OH MY ZSHELL!"

h2. Setup

@oh-my-zsh@ should work with any recent release of "zsh":http://www.zsh.org/, the minimum recommended version is 4.3.9.

h3. The automatic installer... (do you trust me?)

You can install this via the command line with either `curl` or `wget`.
